I followed along with your video introduction to project 1. I understand the purpose of the assignment and am looking forward to implimenting it.

I am starting to better understand closures in the context of a live website and how they are used in a project. That has been tricky. I see how you also connected it to a server to pull in data that could be used on the front end of back end of the project.

I also am recognizing how html and js work together to create the website. Thanks for this assignment and looking forward to getting better at this.
